This project is a Single Page Application for User Signing Up, built using Angular 10.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

I have tested the application by running with 'http-server' for validating production readiness after created the build.
